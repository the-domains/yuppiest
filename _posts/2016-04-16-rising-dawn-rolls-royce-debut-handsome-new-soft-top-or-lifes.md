  The Rolls-Royce Dawn made its debut in an underground car park, just a stone's
  throw from Wallpaper's HQ. Granted, it was the car park beneath Rogers Stirk
  Harbour + Partners' award-winning Neo Bankside development, and the other bays
  were full of Ferraris, Maseratis and other exotic metal.
